# Quest is a text based RPG with traveling, battles, boss battles, magic, monster allies, weapons, etc created in 1995 for the TI-82 Calculator.

The game features a 'panic screen' where users can bring up a screen of math in case a teacher walks by while playing. 

In order to fit the entire game (including 6 images) into just 28K, animations like the sword gleam or Himoko crying are done with mathematical equations. 

To play the game, you can use an emulator like Tilem (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tilem/). Load a ROM file, right click and send the group.82g file and then run the program called Quest. To edit the code on a PC, it's recommended to use Cemetech's SourceCoder (https://www.cemetech.net/sc/)
